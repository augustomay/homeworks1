                <p> This recipe is a very traditional Brazilian mid-afternoon snack, usually eaten with a good cup of coffee. The name of this recipe means "cheese bread", but its main ingredient is actually <i>palvilho azedo</i>, also known in English as sour cassava starch or sour tapioca starch - which is an incorrect name for it, further information <a href =#Tapioca>below</a>. There are many variations for this recipe around the country, but its origin is associated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Gerais">State of Minas Gerais</a>, where pão de queijo is prepared in the most traditional way.</p>
                <h3> Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> 500g of sour cassava starch</li>
                    <li> 1 cup of water </li>
                    <li> 1 cup of fresh milk </li>
                    <li> 1 cup of vegetable oil </li>
                    <li> 2 free-range eggs </li>
                    <li> 100 g of grated cheese, traditionaly we use <a href="https://www.cheese.com/minas-cheese/">Minas cheese</a>, but you can opt for the cheese of your preference, or use not cheese at all</li>
                    <li> A pinch of salt</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> How to prepare: </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> In a medium saucepan, boil the water, milk, oil and salt.</li>
                    <li> Blanch the powder (by pouring hot water) until you manage to knead, that is, to form a dough.</li>
                    <li> When the dough is warm, add the cheese and the free-range eggs.</li>
                    <li> Place in the oven dish with the aid of a spoon, or if you prefer, soak your hands and shape it carefully into golf balls.</li>
                    <li> Keep a good space between the balls on the dish, they grow a lot while baking.</li>
                    <li> To know when to remove them from the oven, observe when they are golden brown on the surface.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2> Coxinha de frango</h2>

                <p> Another nationaly apreciated snack, the origins of this recipe are not easy to track. Some people say it was created in the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo">São Paulo</a>, during the 1920s' industrial boom. Some others say it was created at an imperial farm in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limeira">Limeira</a>, in the late XIX century, in order to feed one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel,_Princess_Imperial_of_Brazil">Princess Isabel</a>'s illegitimate sons. Others say it is a Brazilian version of the French <i>croquette de poulet</i>, created by chef Antonin Carême in the early 1800's. No matter its origins, coxinha de frango, or "chicken little thighs", can be apreciated in every Brazilian canteen.</p>

                </ul>
                <h3> How to prepare:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk, chicken stock and butter.</li>
                    <li> Cook for 5 minutes or until it starts to boil. Add the all-purpose flour all at once and stir the dough with a wooden spoon until it loosens from the bottom of the pan.</li>

                    <li> For the filling, heat a pan with the tablespoons of oil over medium heat and saute the onion for 3 minutes.</li>

                    <li> Roll out portions of the cold dough in your hands, put a little bit of the filling inside them and close them in your hand, shaping the coxinhas like water drops.</li>
                    <li> Mix the water with the eggs in a bowl. Soak the coxinhas through in the water-egg mixture and then through the breadcrumbs.</li>
                    <li> Slowly fry them in hot oil until they are golden.</li>
                    <li> Drain the oil on paper towels and serve.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2> Tapioca</h2>
                <img src= "https://live.staticflickr.com/7042/6938028057_bf0f91bd6f_c.jpg" alt= "Tapioca served on a table with a cup of coffee.">
                <p> A traditional dish from Brazilian Northeast, it is a common substitute for pancakes or omelettes. It is <a href="#PãoDeQueijo">also</a> made from cassava starch, but many foreigners mistakenly use the word tapioca to name this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava">special South American root</a>, which in Brazil is called <i>mandioca</i>, <i>aipim</i> or <i>macaxeira</i>. Tapioca can be bought in stores or can be produced at home using the starch. For fillings, you can choose the same of your favourite omelette or pancake, but in Brazil tapioca is usually filled with dried meat, ham and cheese (salty options) or with grated coconut and sweet condensed milk (sweet option).</p>
                <h3> Ingredients: </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> 2 and a half cups of cassava starch</li>
                    <li> 2 cups of water</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> How to prepare:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Pour the cassava starch in a bowl and cover it with water.</li>
                    <li> Stir with a spoon to dissolve the starch, cover with plastic film and let it rest in the refrigerator for 8 hours.</li>
                    <li> Drain the water left on the surface.</li>
                    <li> Place a clean dish towel over the gum and leave it for a few minutes to absorb excess moisture.</li>
                    <li> With a spoon, break the dough into pieces and pass it through a sieve – the result is a moist, silky flour that shapes when squeezed.</li>
                    <li> To prepare tapiocas, place a small non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li> Lower the heat and sift a portion of the flour until it forms an even layer on the bottom of the pan.</li>
                    <li> Let it cook for about 30 seconds. When it is firm enough, cover it with your prefered filling and then fold it with a spatula. Serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
